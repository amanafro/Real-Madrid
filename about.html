        <h1>Florentino Perez</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Florentino Pérez Rodríguez is a Spanish
            businessman and the president of Real Madrid, one of the most successful
            and prestigious football (soccer) clubs in the world. He was born on
            March 8, 1947, in Madrid, Spain. Pérez is widely recognized for his role
            in transforming Real Madrid into a global sporting powerhouse and for
            his influence on the world of football. He has been instrumental in
            implementing a business model that emphasizes financial stability and
            commercial success alongside on-field achievements. Pérez first became
            involved with Real Madrid in the early 1990s when he joined the club's
            board of directors. In 2000, he successfully ran for the club presidency
            and began his first term. During his initial tenure, Pérez oversaw a
            period known as the "Galácticos era," where he pursued a strategy of
            signing high-profile and expensive players, including Zinedine Zidane,
            Luís Figo, Ronaldo, and David Beckham, among others. This approach aimed
            to strengthen Real Madrid's global brand and attract top talent to the
            club. Under Pérez's leadership, Real Madrid achieved considerable
            success, winning several domestic and international titles, including
            four UEFA Champions League trophies. However, his presidency was not
            without controversy, as critics argued that the club focused too heavily
            on commercial aspects and star signings, potentially neglecting the
            development of young talent and team chemistry. </p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>After stepping down as
            president in 2006, Pérez returned to the position in 2009, beginning his
            second term. During this period, he continued to pursue a similar
            transfer policy, bringing in players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth
            Bale, and Eden Hazard. Real Madrid experienced further success, winning
            four more UEFA Champions League titles and maintaining their status as
            one of the world's most valuable and influential football clubs. Off the
            field, Pérez is also known for his involvement in construction and civil
            engineering. He founded Grupo ACS, a multinational construction company,
            in 1997. His business acumen and success in the construction industry
            have played a significant role in his ability to shape Real Madrid's
            financial stability and engage in high-profile player transfers. While
            Pérez's tenure as Real Madrid president has been marked by significant
            achievements, it has also faced criticism from some fans and pundits who
            question the prioritization of financial gain over the long-term
            development of the club. Nevertheless, his impact on Real Madrid's
            global brand and his influential role in shaping the modern football
            landscape cannot be understated.</p>

        <h1>Santiago Bernabeu</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Santiago Bernabéu de Yeste, often referred to as Santiago Bernabéu, was a
            Spanish footballer and influential figure in the history of Real Madrid.
            Born on June 8, 1895, in Almansa, Spain, Bernabéu is best known as the
            former player, coach, and president of Real Madrid. As a player, Bernabéu
            had a relatively short career due to injuries. He joined Real Madrid in
            1912 and played as a forward until his retirement in 1927. Despite his
            limited playing time, Bernabéu's leadership qualities and passion for the
            club made a lasting impact. He went on to become one of the most
            significant figures in Real Madrid's history. After retiring as a player,
            Bernabéu took up various administrative roles at Real Madrid, eventually
            becoming the club's president in 1943. It was during his presidency that
            Real Madrid experienced its most successful period, both domestically and
            internationally. Bernabéu implemented significant changes and reforms that
            transformed Real Madrid into a footballing powerhouse.</p>

        <div class="text">

          <p>One of Bernabéu's most notable contributions was the construction of the Estadio Santiago
            Bernabéu, Real Madrid's iconic home stadium. The project was initiated in
            the 1940s and completed in 1955. The stadium was named in his honor as a
            tribute to his immense contributions to the club. The Estadio Santiago
            Bernabéu has since become one of the most recognizable and revered
            stadiums in the world of football. Under Bernabéu's leadership, Real
            Madrid won numerous domestic titles, including several La Liga
            championships, as well as a record-breaking five consecutive European Cups
            (now the UEFA Champions League) from 1955 to 1960. This period of success
            solidified Real Madrid's status as one of the greatest football clubs in
            history. Beyond his achievements with Real Madrid, Bernabéu also played a
            crucial role in the development of European club competitions. He was one
            of the driving forces behind the creation of the European Cup (now the
            UEFA Champions League) in 1955, envisioning a tournament that would bring
            together the top clubs from different countries to compete at the highest
            level. Santiago Bernabéu passed away on June 2, 1978, leaving behind a
            profound legacy. He is remembered as a visionary leader, an exceptional
            football administrator, and the architect of Real Madrid's rise to global
            prominence. His contributions to the sport and his enduring influence on
            Real Madrid continue to be celebrated by football fans worldwide.</p>
